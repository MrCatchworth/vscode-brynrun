## 2021-04-12 - 0.0.7

- Unify the style of word highlighting (the read and write versions used to be different)
- Support the "local" keyword in Lua - if you encounter any other missing keywords please let me know!

## 2021-04-07 - 0.0.6

- Various changes to regions such as selection, search results, and same-word highlights - hopefully these regions "pop" a bit more
